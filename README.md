# About

This is an assignment by [Eleven Fifty Academy](https://elevenfifty.org/) related to earning the Gold Badge.

This assignment is titled Static Layout.

## Instructions

The coder will need to recreate a static website from a provided list.

From the list, I selected the [Star Wars](https://www.starwars.com/) website.

Because the website layout changes (updates) every few days, you can find the layout that I was working with in the PNG file named "screenshot_liveSite_06202021".
